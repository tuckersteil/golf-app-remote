# Phase-4 Project 
My phase 4 project called "Last minute tee times", where users can post and book tee times.  The purpose of this project is to allow golfers to repost a tee time that theyve already booked with a course, where they can no longer make it or just dont want it anymore rather than canceling that time (where they might be charged) or just not using it. While also being able to book posted teetimes from other users.  The intent is allow golfers another location to find tee times and to make sure all tee times are being used rather than wasted. 

# Functionality 
1. To use the site a user must sign up for an account first. After doing so they can log in and will be taken to the home page.
2. The home page will display a list of golf courses, to which they can click on one and be taken to that course page. 
3. Once theyre on the course page the user will be able to see teetimes for that current day, and additionally be able to toggle dates on a calendar to see teetimes for other days. 
4. While still on the course page, a user can book tee times or post a tee time for other users to book. 
5. If they choose to book one, they will be taken to a confirmation page where they can confirm booking, which will then take them to their tee times page which displays posted and booked teetimes for that user. 
6. If they choose to post a tee time, a pop up form will appear for them to do so, and after hitting submit it will post that teetime for that course, time, and date. The user can see their posted tee time either on the course's page or in the "my tee times" tab in the nav bar. 

# Future use 
As of now, if you were to book a teetime that another user posted it would show up in your booked teetimes and no longer in the other users posted teetimes.  So an additional funtionality that would be needed in the app is a payment system, that tracks the exchanging of teetimes in addition to charging users for booking and paying other users for selling.
